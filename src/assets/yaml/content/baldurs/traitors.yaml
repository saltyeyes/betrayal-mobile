            - Place the large Beholder monster token on your adventurer's tile.
            - Get the Turn/Damage track and set the slider equal to twice the number of adventurers. This represents the Beholder's hit points.
            - Set aside all of the triangular quest tokens. These represent magical barriers that prevent the Beholder from dreaming.
            - Set aside a number of small monster tokens equal to the number of adventurers. These represent Beholderkin.

        - title: Allowing the Beholder to Sleep
          body:
            - If the Beholder can no longer sleep (because all omen tiles have quest tokens on them), instead of attacking, you may attempt a Knowledge or Sanity 4+ roll while on an omen tile to let it dream again. If you succeed, remove all quest tokens from the board.
        - title: You Must Do This at the Start of the Monster Turn
          body:
            - If there is at least one omen tile without a quest token on it, the Beholder's dreams will continue. Otherwise, if all omen tiles have quest tokens, the Beholder goes insane, as it has no way to sleep.

                - Roll 2 dice to determine which eye ray the Beholder uses with each attack. The listed effect is in addition to any damage inflicted

        - title: Beholder Dreaming
          body:
            - If the Beholder ends its turn on an omen tile without a quest token, it falls asleep. Flip its token over to the stunned ("S") side. While it is sleeping, it spawns a Beholderkin. Place a small monster token on its stunned ("S") side on an adjacent tile that doesn't already contain a Beholderkin token, if possible. Then place a quest token on the Beholder's tile.
            - If the number of Beholderkin tokens on the board equals the number of adventurers, the traitor wins!

            - For this haunt, the traitor stays in the room while the heroes exit to read and discuss their strategy.
            - Your adventurer is still in the game but has turned traitor. You were Glurk all along, the infamous goblin overlord who seeks to enslave Baldur's Gate.
            - If your Speed and/or Might traits are below their starting values, reset them to their starting values.
            - Gain 2 Speed and 2 Might
            - Collect a number of small monster tokens equal to twice the number of heroes, representing Goblins. Place them on your tile.
            - On a piece of paper, secretly write down a tile on the catacomb level to represent the slave pens. Keep this hidden from the heroes until you bring the first hero there and remove them from the game.
        - title: What You Know About the Heroes
          body:

            - ...all the heroes are either killed or removed from the game.
        - title: Enslaving a hero
          body:
            - When you or your Goblins defeat a hero in combat, in addition to taking damage, that hero becomes {enslaved|bold}. An enslaved hero must be taken to the tile you designated as the slave pens to be removed from the game. If they are freed before they reach the slave pens, they are returned to their player's control.
            - Once a hero is enslaved, lay the adventurer figure on its side.
        - title: Moving an Enslaved hero
          body:
            - Whenever you or a Goblin exits a tile containing an enslaved hero, you may move the hero as well. Each Goblin can carry only one hero at a time, but it can pass them off to another Goblin, which can then move the hero again. Thus an enslaved hero can be moved multiple times per monster turn.
            - As soon as an enslaved hero is moved onto the slave pens tile, remove them from the game. They have been sacrificed to Maglubiyet.
        - title: Calling More Goblins
          body:
            - Instead of moving during your traitor turn, you may roll 2 dice, then put that many Goblin tokens on your tile or any tile(s) containing a Goblin.

                - Two or more Goblins on the same tile can add their Might scores together to make a single mob attack roll against a hero on that tile (maximum of 8 dice).
                - If the Goblins lose, distribute any damage inflicted among the participating Goblins (no more than 1 point each). Stun each Goblin that takes damage in this way.
        - title: If You Win...
          body:
            - You stand defiant with your swarms of goblins, all united under your iron fist, their eyes filled with bloodlust and awaiting your commands.

            - If there are fewer than 8 catacomb tiles on the board (including the Catacomb Landing/Kitchen Basement start tile), draw and place tiles from the catacomb stack until there are 8 catacomb tiles on the board.
            - You may rearrange all of the catacomb tiles in any order you want, placing the quest token on a tile as far from teh Kitchen Basement as possible.

        - title: Rotating a Tile
          body:
            - To rotate a tile, pick it up, turn it one or more sides, and place it back down where it began.
        - title: Shifting a Tile
          body:
            - To shift a tile (or group of tiles at once) detach one tile from adjacent connected tile and move it to another door on the same tile. If detaching a tile also detaches a group of tiles beyond it, you may connect any tile in that detached group to the previously connected tile. This counts as one shift.

            - title: Special Charging Attack Rules
              body:
                - Instead of moving and attacking normally, you may make a charging attack once per turn. if the heroes have collected the key, your rage allows you to now charge twice per turn.
                - To charge, move in a straight direction through open doors, as far as you like regardless of Speed, making an attack against each hero whose tile you enter or exit (one attack per hero per charge).
            - title: Damaging the Minotaur
              body:
                - Ignore the normal stun rules for monsters. If the Minotaur takes 2 or more damage from a single effect (normally an attack), remove a small monster token from in front of you. If you don't have a small monster token to remove, the Minotaur is killed and the heroes win!

      flavor:
        - The derelict shrine would be a sad sight if not for the rich foliage that marks nature's resolve to reclaim its purchase on this artificial space. You wander toward a moss-covered altar, drawn by an urge to kneel before it. There you reach down and unearth a mass of roots.
        - At once, whispers fill your mind and you're struck by visions of an unnaturally gnarled tree of magnificent proportions. It drinks darkness from the very soil beneath your feet, rising from an unseen grotto underground. The vines that long ago took over this place caress your ankles, sending shivers up your legs.
        - The whispers from before are clear to you now as you utter them aloud. "Sow the seeds... sow the seeds of the Gulthias Tree."

            - Place the Branch tokens on the board so that each is at least 4 tiles away from the others. Treat any sewer grate tiles as connected to the Catacomb landing, and paired tiles with stairs (such as the Kitchen and the Kitchen Basement) as connected to each other. If that isn't possible, draw and place tiles of the appropriate level until there are enough to place all the Branch tokens. Then place 2 Vine Blight tokens on each tile containing a Branch.

          body:
            - Remove any Vine Blights that aren't connected to a Branch from the board. To be connected, each tile between the Vine Blight and a Branch (including the Branch's tile) must contain a Vine Blight.
            - Then, move each stunned Vine Blight 1 tile closer to the Branch it is connected to. If this movement causes any Vine Blights to become unconnected, they also each move 1 tile closer to the previously connected Branch.

            - To connect Branches, there must be at least 1 unstunned Vine Blight on each of the tiles containing those Branches, and on every tile in between.

          body: 
            - Instead of attacking, you may coax a new Branch into the world. You must be on a tile that is at least 4 tiles away from existing Branch tokens. Attempt a Knowledge 4+ roll, increasing the difficulty by 1 for each hero on your tile. If successful, place a new Branch token and 2 stunned Vine Blights on your tile.
            - Branches cannot be moved or placed. They are considered opponents to the heroes for the purposes of attacks, but they do not impede movement.

                - During the monster turn, Vine Blights may multiply if 2 or more are on the same tile. Instead of attacking, 2 Vine Blights on a tile may combine their Might values to attempt a Might roll of 6+. If successful, place another Vine Blight token on the tile. It cannot move, attack, or multiply on the turn it is created.
            - title: Protecting the Branches
              body:
                - Heroes will attempt to destroy Branches with Might 5+ rolls. However, every 2 unstunned Vine Blights on a Branch's tile increases the difficulty of this roll by 1.

          body:
            - Having fulfilled your part, you turn your palms out in supplication, and the vines wrap around your body in an unholy embrace. You become one with the dark horror, seeing through the eyes of the Gulthias Tree. Slithering creepers cover the walls of Baldur's Gate in an all-consuming hunger. The sweet slumber of death comes to everything in your path.
