      author: Ben Petrisor 
      flavor:
        - Your master, the beholder Brakxus, descends from above, its slimy eyestalks seeking a target.
        - "What is your bidding, my master?" you ask.
        - "Tonight, I shall dream an army, and we shall enslave this city!"

          body:
            - For this haunt, the traitor stays in the room while the heroes exit to read and discuss their strategy.
            - Your adventurer is still in the game but has turned traitor.
            - Place the large Beholder monster token on your adventurer's tile.
            - Get the Turn/Damage track and set the slider equal to twice the number of adventurers. This represents the Beholder's hit points.
            - Set aside all of the triangular quest tokens. These represent magical barriers that prevent the Beholder from dreaming.
            - Set aside a number of small monster tokens equal to the number of adventurers. These represent Beholderkin.
        - title: What You Know About the Heroes
          body:
            - They are trying to stop your master by driving it insane!
        - title: You Win When...
          style: list-or
          body:
            - you have killed all the heroes
            - the number of Beholderkin on the board equals the number of adventurers.
        - title: You Must Do This at the Start of Your Turn
          body:
            - If the Beholder is asleep (it's flipped to its "S" side), flip its token back over.
        - title: Allowing the Beholder to Sleep
          body:
            - If the Beholder can no longer sleep (because all omen tiles have quest tokens on them), instead of attacking, you may attempt a Knowledge or Sanity 4+ roll while on an omen tile to let it dream again. If you succeed, remove all quest tokens from the board.
        - title: You Must Do This at the Start of the Monster Turn
          body:
            - If there is at least one omen tile without a quest token on it, the Beholder's dreams will continue. Otherwise, if all omen tiles have quest tokens, the Beholder goes insane, as it has no way to sleep.

                - The Beholder can attack a target on its tile or an adjacent connected tile. When it takes an attack action, it can attack up to two targets within range. It cannot attack the same target twice. If it loses an attack against a target that is not on its tile, it takes no damage.
                - If the Beholder is insane, it must attempt to attack the closest of the traitor and/or Beholderkin. Otherwise it can attack heroes within range.
                - Roll 2 dice to determine which eye ray the Beholder uses with each attack. The listed effect is in addition to any damage inflicted

        - title: Damaging the Beholder
          body:
            - Whenever the Beholder takes damage, move the slider down the Turn/Damage track by that amount. If it reaches 0, the Beholder has been killed.
        - title: Beholder Dreaming
          body:
            - If the Beholder ends its turn on an omen tile without a quest token, it falls asleep. Flip its token over to the stunned ("S") side. While it is sleeping, it spawns a Beholderkin. Place a small monster token on its stunned ("S") side on an adjacent tile that doesn't already contain a Beholderkin token, if possible. Then place a quest token on the Beholder's tile.
            - If the number of Beholderkin tokens on the board equals the number of adventurers, the traitor wins!

          body:
            - You are surrounded by your master and its brood. "You have served me well." Brakxus says, as its eyes takein the corpses of your former comrades. "Soon Baldur's Gate will fall, and all will serve Brakxus!"
  2:  name:   Glurk Rises  
      author: Adam Lee
      flavor:
        - You finally reveal your previous self to be an illusion. It's goblin time!
      sections:
        - title: Right Now
          style: list
          body:
            - For this haunt, the traitor stays in the room while the heroes exit to read and discuss their strategy.
            - Your adventurer is still in the game but has turned traitor. You were Glurk all along, the infamous goblin overlord who seeks to enslave Baldur's Gate.
            - If your Speed and/or Might traits are below their starting values, reset them to their starting values.
            - Gain 2 Speed and 2 Might
            - Collect a number of small monster tokens equal to twice the number of heroes, representing Goblins. Place them on your tile.
            - On a piece of paper, secretly write down a tile on the catacomb level to represent the slave pens. Keep this hidden from the heroes until you bring the first hero there and remove them from the game.
        - title: What You Know About the Heroes
          body:
            - They are trying to kill you.
        - title: You Win When...
          body:
            - ...all the heroes are either killed or removed from the game.
        - title: Enslaving a hero
          body:
            - When you or your Goblins defeat a hero in combat, in addition to taking damage, that hero becomes {enslaved|bold}. An enslaved hero must be taken to the tile you designated as the slave pens to be removed from the game. If they are freed before they reach the slave pens, they are returned to their player's control.
            - Once a hero is enslaved, lay the adventurer figure on its side.
        - title: Moving an Enslaved hero
          body:
            - Whenever you or a Goblin exits a tile containing an enslaved hero, you may move the hero as well. Each Goblin can carry only one hero at a time, but it can pass them off to another Goblin, which can then move the hero again. Thus an enslaved hero can be moved multiple times per monster turn.
            - As soon as an enslaved hero is moved onto the slave pens tile, remove them from the game. They have been sacrificed to Maglubiyet.
        - title: Calling More Goblins
          body:
            - Instead of moving during your traitor turn, you may roll 2 dice, then put that many Goblin tokens on your tile or any tile(s) containing a Goblin.

            - title: Special Goblin Mob Attack Rules
              body:
                - Two or more Goblins on the same tile can add their Might scores together to make a single mob attack roll against a hero on that tile (maximum of 8 dice).
                - If the Goblins lose, distribute any damage inflicted among the participating Goblins (no more than 1 point each). Stun each Goblin that takes damage in this way.
        - title: If You Win...
          body:
            - You stand defiant with your swarms of goblins, all united under your iron fist, their eyes filled with bloodlust and awaiting your commands. Buildings are ablaze and the sounds of people in panic fill your pointy ears with glee. You shriek with goblin fury, "Tonight we crush the humans! Tonight we feast on the bones of Baldur's Gate!"
