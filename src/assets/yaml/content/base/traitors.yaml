  title: The Mummy Walks
  id: 1
  flavor:
    - The wall in front of you shivers and slides away to reveal an ancient sarcophagus, its curved lid dusty and covered with hieroglyphs. The hieroglyphs glow softly, drawing you to them. A raspy voice slides into your mind, saying, “I lost my bride more years ago than you could possibly comprehend. My tears are dust, but my love is still as strong as the sun. Now my love is reborn to me. Mortal hands shall not keep me from reuniting with her.”
    = As the voice fades, you smile. It’s so clear. Your friends must die so the lovers can be reunited. As the lid slides off the sarcophagus, you turn to meet your new friend... your new god.

    body:
      - Your character is still in the game but has turned traitor.
      - Put the Mummy token (large) and the Sarcophagus token (pentagonal) in the room where the haunt was revealed.
      - You lose the Girl and any bonuses from the Girl card. Put the Girl token (crimson) in any room on the same floor as the room where the haunt was and at least five tiles away from the Mummy. If no rooms are at least five tiles away, place her as far away as possible on that floor.
      - Set aside the Girl card. When an explorer enters the same room as the Girl token, that player takes the Girl card.
      - If you get the Girl, you can give her to the Mummy while you’re in the same room. The Mummy then becomes the Girl’s custodian.

      - ...the Mummy is the Girl’s custodian, has the Ring or the Holy Symbol, and returns with them to the room with the Sarcophagus, or else all heroes are dead. If neither the Ring nor the Holy Symbol is in play the next time you discover a room with an Omen symbol, search through the Omen deck and draw either card. 
  - title: The Mummy Must Do This...
    tags: []
    body:
      - ...during it's turn\: If the Mummy rolls a 0 or a 1 for its movement, it may use a secret passage to move to any space in the house.
      - Once during the monster turn, the Mummy must attack one explorer in the same room (if it can).
      - The Mummy can carry items and act as the Girl’s custodian, but the Girl and those items don’t affect his traits. You may transfer items and the Girl to the Mummy if you are in the same space. 
  - title: Special Attack Rules
    tags:
      - special-attack-rules
    body:
      - The Mummy makes Might attacks but inflicts Speed damage until its opponent’s Speed is at its lowest number. (This attack can’t lower that trait to the skull symbol.) After that, its opponent takes Might damage instead until he or she is dead.
      - When the Mummy inflicts 2 or more points of damage with an attack, it can steal an item from its opponent instead of inflicting that damage. The Mummy can also take the Girl from her custodian this way.
      - The Mummy is immune to Speed attacks (such as the Revolver and Dynamite).

      - The girl sits crumpled in the corner, crying out to you for help. The mummy crosses the room and picks her up in its linen-clad arms. Slowly, tenderly, the mummy breathes into the wailing girl’s mouth. Her cries soften and her tears glow amber as her eyes turn upward.
      - “My Priest, my love ... we are together once more,” croons the fragile girl, “and soon the world will worship us. Their flesh will be ours to burn, their souls ours to feast upon ... .”

    - "A dread chill descends upon the house, and a voice clatters through the air, “I must rest ... put my soul to rest ...or die ... .” As the words fade, the spirit board you are carrying begins to throb, matching the rhythm of your heart. Looking down at the board, you see the mist coil into letters on its surface:"

      - Your character is still in the game but has turned traitor.
      - Set aside the Ghost token (light green).
      - If the Pentagram Chamber isn’t in the house, search the room stack for it and put it next to a Basement doorway at least five tiles away from you. (If there are no Basement doorways at least five tiles away, put it as far away from you as you can.) Then shuffle that stack.

      - They are trying to summon the Ghost before you do.
      - If they succeed, they’ll gain control of the Ghost and receive a quest to complete.
      - If they fail, they’ll try to destroy the Ghost instead.

  - title: How to Summon the Ghost
    tags:
      - how-to
    body:
      - There’s a race between you and the other explorers to summon the Ghost. To summon it, you must conduct a séance.
      - While you have the Spirit Board, you can attempt a Knowledge roll or a Sanity roll. During your turn, you can attempt only one of these rolls. A 5+ succeeds. When you’ve succeeded at one Knowledge roll and one Sanity roll, you’ve summoned the ghost.
      - The heroes are also attempting Knowledge and Sanity rolls to summon the Ghost. If you succeed with your summoning before they do, put the Ghost token next to your character. If the other explorers succeed first, they will tell you what happens.

    body:
      - "Ghost’s declaration (read aloud):"
      - style: read-aloud
        text:  ”I will have my revenge against the living!”
      - If the traitor dies, you keep control of the Ghost. The Ghost must move toward a hero during each turn you control it, attacking if it can.
      - At the end of your first turn in control of the Ghost, the house begins collapsing. The first room to collapse must be the Attic (or, if the Attic isn’t in the house, any unoccupied upper floor room). After that, at the end of each explorer’s turn, tell that explorer to choose a new room to collapse.
      - To collapse a room, choose a room tile and turn it over so its back is showing. A room can’t collapse unless it is adjacent to another collapsed room. The adjacent rooms don’t need to have connecting doors. Diagonal is not adjacent. If an occupied room collapses, all explorers in that room are killed (including you).
      - Once the entire upper floor has collapsed, start collapsing the ground floor beginning with the Grand Staircase. Use tokens to mark the Grand Staircase, Foyer, and Entrance Hall as they collapse. Once the ground floor is gone, collapse the basement starting at the Basement Landing.
      - If the Mystic Elevator’s roll would take it to a floor where there are no uncollapsed rooms with open doorways, then it does not move.
      - Only the Ghost can pass through collapsed rooms. The Ghost can move through walls and collapsed rooms. You control the Ghost if you summon it first or if the heroes summon it first but then fail in their quest. 
  - title: Special Attack Rules
    tags:
      - special-attack-rules
    body:
      - No one can attack until after the séance has been completed.
      - The Ghost makes Sanity attacks which cause mental damage. The possessor of the Ring or anyone in the Pentagram Chamber can make Sanity attacks against the Ghost.
      - If the Ghost attacks and rolls lower than a hero, it is not harmed.

      - The mists fill the house now, from top to bottom. You glide through them, as silent as the ghost hovering by your side. Your heartbeat slows and stills. Silence. Now there are two spirits destined to haunt this place together. Forever.
